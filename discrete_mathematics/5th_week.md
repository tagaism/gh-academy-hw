**Use a direct proof to show that every odd integer is the difference of two squares:**
1.  **Represent an odd integer:** Let *n* be an arbitrary odd integer. By definition, an odd integer can be expressed as 2*k* + 1 for some integer *k*.

2.  **Express as difference of squares:** We want to show that *n* can be written in the form *x*<sup>2</sup> - *y*<sup>2</sup> for some integers *x* and *y*.

3.  **Choose values for x and y:** Let's choose *x* = *k* + 1 and *y* = *k*.

4.  **Substitute and simplify:** Now, let's substitute these values of *x* and *y* into the expression *x*<sup>2</sup> - *y*<sup>2</sup>:
    *x*<sup>2</sup> - *y*<sup>2</sup> = (*k* + 1)<sup>2</sup> - *k*<sup>2</sup>
    = (*k*<sup>2</sup> + 2*k* + 1) - *k*<sup>2</sup>
    = 2*k* + 1

5.  **Conclusion:** Since 2*k* + 1 is equal to *n*, we have shown that *n* = *x*<sup>2</sup> - *y*<sup>2</sup>, where *x* = *k* + 1 and *y* = *k*. Since *k* is an integer, *x* and *y* are also integers. Therefore, we have expressed the arbitrary odd integer *n* as the difference of two squares.

$\therefore$ every odd integer is the difference of two squares.

The sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.

**Proof by contradiction:**

1.  **Assume the opposite:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is rational.

2.  **Set up variables:** Let $x$ be an irrational number and $y$ be a rational number. According to our assumption, their sum ($x + y$) is rational.

3.  **Express rational numbers:** Since $y$ and ($x + y$) are rational, they can be expressed as fractions:
    * $y = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b 
eq 0$.
    * $x + y = \frac{c}{d}$, where $c$ and $d$ are integers and $d 
eq 0$.

4.  **Isolate x:** Now, let's isolate $x$ in the second equation:
    * $x = (\frac{c}{d}) - y$

5.  **Substitute for y:** Substitute the expression for $y$ ($\frac{a}{b}$) into the equation:
    * $x = (\frac{c}{d}) - (\frac{a}{b})$

6.  **Simplify:** Find a common denominator and simplify the right side:
    * $x = \frac{bc - ad}{bd}$

7.  **Analyze the result:** Since $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers, the expression $$\frac{bc - ad}{bd}$$ is also a ratio of two integers. This means that $x$ is a rational number.

8.  **Contradiction:** This contradicts our initial assumption that $x$ is an irrational number.

9.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, our assumption that the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is rational must be false. Thus, the sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.
