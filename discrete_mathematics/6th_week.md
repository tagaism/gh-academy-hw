a) The set given in part (a) is $\{a, b, \{a, b\}\}$.

To find the number of elements in the power set of this set, $\mathcal{P}(\{a, b, \{a, b\}\})$, we first need to determine the number of distinct elements in the original set.

The distinct elements are:
1. $a$
2. $b$
3. $\{a, b\}$

Since there are $n = 3$ distinct elements in the original set, the cardinality of its power set is given by $2^n$.

Therefore, the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\{a, b, \{a, b\}\})$ is $2^3 = 8$.\


b) The set given in part (b) is $\{\emptyset, a, \{\{a\}\}\}$.

To find the number of elements in the power set of this set, $\mathcal{P}(\{\emptyset, a, \{\{a\}\}\})$, we first need to determine the number of distinct elements in the original set.

The distinct elements are:
1. $\emptyset$ (the empty set)
2. $a$ (the element $a$)
3. $\{\{a\}\}$ (a set containing a set that contains $a$)

Since there are $n = 3$ distinct elements in the original set, the cardinality of its power set is given by $2^n$.

Therefore, the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(\{\emptyset, a, \{\{a\}\}\})$ is $2^3 = 8$.
