**Simplify the expression $\log_2\left(\frac{8\sqrt{2}}{16}\right) + \log_2(32) - 2\log_2(4)$**\
$\log_2(8)+\frac{1}{2}\log_2(2) - \log_2(16) + \log_2(32) - 2\log_2(4)$\
$3 + \frac{1}{2} - 4 + 5 - 4 = \frac{1}{2}$\
#### 2
**Solve for $x$: $\log_3(x-1) + \log_3(x + 1) = 2$**\
$\log_3((x - 1)(x + 1)) = 2$\
$x^2 - 1 = 9$\
$x^2 = 10$\
$x = \pm\sqrt{10}$\
Since $-\sqrt{10}$ is can not be a solution, because $(-\sqrt{10} - 1) < 0$\
The solution of the equation is: $x = \sqrt{10}$
