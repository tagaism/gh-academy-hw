Since for some relations we have 2 results though it's not a functions.

a. For any input $x$ we have exactly one $y$. Therefore a is a function.\
b. For any input $x$ we have more than one $y$. b is not a function.

$f$ is injective and $h$ is injective (therefore $h$ is bijective since it can be both)

**Find the slope of the line that passes through the points (-1, 2) and (3, -4). Plot the points and graph the line**\
$y = mx + b$\
$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-4 - 2}{3 - (-1)} = -\frac{3}{2}$\
Let's find $b$. Since it is a constant it will fit for any point for our line. Let's use the point (3, -4)
$-4 = -\frac{3}{2}x + b$\
$b = 4.5 - 4 = 0.5$\
=> the equation of our line is:\
$y = -\frac{3}{2} + 0.5$\
Now let's build the graph:\
